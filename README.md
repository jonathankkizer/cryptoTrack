**Beta Release Notes**:
- Implement write to userdefaults for account creation with User class (in order to have accounts persist between app states)
- Implement currency changer in settings (UISegmentControl, similar to implementation within account creation; simply switches User currency attribute)
- Design changes (help our app looks super bland... thoughts?) [possibly expand on the most positive changes section to be larger/add a view for it]
